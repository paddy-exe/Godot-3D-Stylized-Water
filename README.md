# Godot-Stylized-Water
 
![](StylizedWater.gif)

This shader was ported from this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHdDUqJHJxM) and some parts were taken from the awesome tutorial by [Kmitt 91](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgcMXPdQrLI) and the water shader tutorial by [Bastiaan Olij](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm9Sdvhq6ho). To understand how the Water shader works in Godot specifically, I would recommend watching both of the two Godot videos.

The shader has
* Waves with customizable strength, frequency and time factor
* DepthFade between a Shallow and Deep water color
* Customizable flow speed
* Foam with custom color (using 2 noise textures)
